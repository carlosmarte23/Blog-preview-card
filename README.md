## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Given that i struggled a little bit with CSS grid on the previous challenge, i decided to try to do this one with CSS grid. I did a bit of reasearch on how to use it and it was a bit easier than the previous challenge.

Also i learned how to do font size scaling using calc() function, which is a very useful function and in conjunction with relative units, I could complete the challenge.

```css
.card__title {
  font-size: clamp(1.25rem, 4vw, 1.5rem);
}
```

### Continued development

I'll still need to practice more with CSS grid, but i think i'm getting the hang of it. Also I'd like to start using other CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for future projects.

### Useful resources

- [Learn CSS Grid the easy way by Kevin Powel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU) - This video was one of the main one that I used to helpe me get the hang of CSS Grid.

- [Chat GPT](https://chatgpt.com/) - Also used this to help me with some CSS Grid properties and help me calculate the font size scaling using relative units.
